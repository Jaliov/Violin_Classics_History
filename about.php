                ">Great violinists (and one violist) from the 1940's to the present, perform masterworks of the
                concerto repertoire with some of the world's greatest orchestras and conductors!<br><br>These are presented as excerpts in chronological order from the 18th century through the
                20th century and representing the Baroque, Classical, late Classical, Romantic and late Romantic
                eras in Western music.<br><br>
                This can serve as a wonderful brief survey of the history of Western classical music and the greatness of the violin, as well as a wonderful resource for students.<br><br>
