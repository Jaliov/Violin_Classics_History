Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (born May 7, 1840, Votkinsk, Russiaâ€”died November 6, 1893, St. Petersburg), was a Russian composer of the Romantic period. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally. His music has always had great appeal for the general public in virtue of its tuneful, open-hearted melodies, impressive harmonies, and colourful, picturesque orchestration, all of which evoke a profound emotional response. His oeuvre includes 7 symphonies, 11 operas, 3 ballets, 5 suites, 3 piano concertos, a violin concerto, 11 overtures, 4 cantatas, 20 choral works, 3 string quartets, a string sextet, and more than 100 songs and piano pieces. The Violin Concerto in D was written in 1878. It was at first considered unplayable, due to its many double stops, glissandi, trills, leaps, and dissonances, but has since become a standard of the repertoire.
