Anne-Sophie Mutter, (born June 29, 1963, Rheinfelden, W.Ger. [now Germany]), German violinist, who was a superstar in the world of classical music. Although she was sometimes criticized for idiosyncratic, even willful, interpretations of the standard repertoire, she displayed an impeccable technique and produced a sound that was known for its beauty and coloration.

Mutter began piano lessons at age five but after a few months switched to the violin. At age six, after only a year of study, she won first prize with special distinction in violin in a national competition for young musicians and with her brother Christoph took a prize for the performance of a piano piece for four hands. When four years later she once more won first prize in the violin competition, she was asked not to enter again. The conductor Herbert von Karajan, who became an early mentor, first heard her in 1976, and in 1977, at age 13, she made her professional debut with Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. As she began the transition from child prodigy to adult virtuoso, her career was managed by her father, who strictly limited her appearances, but she later played 100 or more concerts a year.

Mutter has appeared with orchestras throughout the world, played in chamber groups, and given solo recitals. She received many awards and honours for her recordings, including the Grand Prix du Disque and four Grammy Awards (in 1993, 1998, 1999, and 2004).
